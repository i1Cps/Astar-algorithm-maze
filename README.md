## ➤ ::pencil:: About The Project

[This project](https://maze.theo-moore-calters.online) showcases the power of the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) through interactive maze solving and generation. Built using TypeScript, Three.js and React, it offers a visually engaging demonstration of pathfinding in action. Users can explore the process of maze generation and watch as the A* algorithm efficiently navigates these intricate labyrinths. This project provides both an educational experience and an intriguing glimpse into the world of algorithmic problem-solving.

## ➤ :rocket: Dependencies

The A* search algorithm is implemented in TypeScript to handle the logic behind maze solving. For the visual representation of maze generation and solving, this project leverages the Three.js library. To provide a user-friendly interface and deploy the application as a web-based tool, it's encapsulated within a React application.

## ➤ :floppy_disk: Key Project File Description

*  The `main.ts` file is the entry point for the A* search algorithm maze demonstration, responsible for initializing the scene, camera, and controls, managing the animation loop, and handling user interactions.
* The `maze.ts` file encapsulates the core logic for generating and managing the maze within the demonstration. It includes methods for setting up the maze grid, creating it, and managing its state.
* The `mazeCell.ts` class represents the logic for individual cells in the maze. It contains various properties and methods to manage the state and appearance of each cell.
* The `AStarMazeSolver` class is responsible for implementing the A* algorithm to solve a maze.
